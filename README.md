This is a reproduction attempt for the paper "Classification with noisy labels by importance reweighting" [1].

The 'Code' folder contains the experiment code run in the reproduction attempts. Note: Our code depends on an implementation of the Kullback-Leibler Importance Estimation Procedure. Details on the implementation of this was not provided in the paper, so a third-party implementation was used and is avilable in the 'KLEIP' folder.

The 'Data' folder contains the data the reproduction attempt was performed with.

The 'Results' folder contains the results achieved from re-running the experiments.
